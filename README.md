Fake News Detection with TF-IDF and SHAP
In this project, I trained a logistic regression model to classify news articles as either FAKE or REAL using TF-IDF vectorization.

To understand the model's decisions, I used SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret the impact of each word on the prediction.

Hereâ€™s an example of how the model interprets one article:

ðŸ”¹ True Label: FAKE 

ðŸ”¹ Model Prediction: FAKE âœ…

ðŸ”¹ TF-IDF + SHAP shows which words pushed the model toward this decision.
